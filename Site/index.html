                            I started doing CTFs because of a course that I took my senior year at DU. It was about white-hat hacking, and how 
                            some companies actually would pay you to hack them-- if you did it the "right way." I really enjoyed this class, and 
                            part of the final project involved proving that you had retained certain skills from the class. The best way to do that,
                            he said, was to do a few CTFs. I have done a few, but have only done one through my personal account in TryHackMe during the course. Once the weather 
                            gets cold again, I am sure I will end up doing more to pass the time. My username is renpratt on TryHackMe, if you want to check 
                            out what I have done there.

                            The <b>BinaryCalculator</b> class is a utility for performing basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
                            and division—on binary numbers represented by the BitField class. The class uses bitwise operations to carry out these calculations, 
                            which is efficient for binary arithmetic. It uses only binary logic to complete these equations, as an excersize in understanding how 
                            binary numbers function. Here is a <a href="https://github.com/renPratt/BinaryCalculator" target="_blank"> GitHub page</a> for the code.

                           Because I was in my school's honors program, I had to get a distinction in one of my majors. I ended up getting 
                           a distinction in Criminology, but my thesis was a crossection of both of my majors, and one of the three professors
                           on my advisory board was a Computer Science professor of mine. The paper is about how UX design of government sites
                           makes it unnessesarily difficult to apply for benefits that you are eligible for if you are unhoused, as well as 
                           about how blockchain could be used in the healthcare sector to help the unhoused. You can read my thesis

                           decided to write this paper by checking out

                            This project was for a course I took about AI and machine learning when I was studying abroad in Greece. We ended up doing 
                            a tournament in class where AIs played against eachother. I got second place, and an A in the course. It was really fun, 
                            but we all had to build it in a time-crunch as part of the course, so it isn't the most clean work I have done. Still, I think
                            it was a very fun and interesting course, and I enjoyed writing the code. Here it the <a href="https://github.com/renPratt/AISuperTicTacToe" target="_blank">

                            into a pretty competative job market without many projects outside of classwork under my belt, and I thought that 
                            this would be a good way to show that I have the ability to code outside of my university.

                            I was taking a course on Human Computer Interaction, and the final assignment was to find UX design flaws in a 
                            popular website or app, and otherwise figure out how to modify a popular website or app in ways that would improve 
                            it for users, and possibly make it more popular. I chose BeReal because I felt like it was an app that was extremely 
                            popular at one point, but had been expiriencing a slow decline, so it was a fun challenge to pick BeReal and 
                            try to figure out what changes could be made to increase consumers regular use of the app. This project involved 
                            interviewing, creating flow models, WAAD, prototyping, and creating usage scenarios, among other things. You can take a

                            This is just a fun one that I did my freshman year at DU. I have it at the bottom because it is neither complex nor
                            perfect, but I remember loving the process. We were given a lot of leeway to decide what we wanted the plant to do,
                            which was new to me in the world of coding-- I was used to being told exactly what the goal looked like. It was one 
                            of the first times I got to be creative with my code. It was a really fast project, which is part of why it is very simple,
                            but I think it is nice to show where I started.
